For AWS KMS, the KMS configuration looks like this.

[source, yaml]
----
kms: AwsKmsService                                            # <1>
kmsConfig:
  endpointUrl: https://kms.<region>.amazonaws.com             # <2>
  tls:                                                        # <3>
  accessKey:
    passwordFile: /opt/aws/accessKey                          # <4>
  secretKey:
    passwordFile: /opt/aws/secretKey                          # <5>
  region: <region>                                            # <6>
