= AWS Key Management Service

Using the Administrator actor, use the AWS Console or CLI to
{aws}/kms/latest/developerguide/create-keys.html#create-symmetric-cmk[create] a "Symmetric key" with "Encrypt and decrypt"
usage.

Give the key an alias following the alias naming convention established above.

If using the CLI, this can be done with commands like this:

[source,shell]
----
aws kms create-key
# the create key command will produce JSON output including the KeyId
aws kms create-alias --alias-name alias/KEK_<name> --target-key-id <KeyId>
----

TIP: Once the key is created, it is recommended to use a key rotation policy.
