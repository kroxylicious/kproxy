= AWS Key Management Service

Using the Administrator actor, use the AWS Console to
{aws}/kms/latest/developerguide/create-keys.html#create-symmetric-cmk[create] a "Symmetric key" with "Encrypt and decrypt"
usage.

Give the key an alias following the alias naming convention established above.  Grant the Filter Actor
{aws}/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policy-default.html#key-policy-default-allow-users[usage permission] on the new key.
This is step 4 of the key creation workflow if using the AWS Console.

TIP: Once the key is created, it is recommended to use a key rotation policy.
