## Build

JDK version 20 or newer, and Apache Maven are required for building this project.

Kroxylicious targets language level 17, except for the `integrationtests` module
which targets 20 to access some new language features.

Build the project like this:

```
$ mvn clean install
```

The running of the tests can be controlled with the following Maven properties:

| property           | description                                                                               |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `-DskipUTs=true`   | skip unit tests                                                                           |
| `-DskipITs=true`   | skip integration tests                                                                    |
| `-DskipTests=true` | skip all tests                                                                            |
| `-Pdebug`          | enables logging so you can see what the Kafka clients, Proxy and in VM brokers are up to. |

The kafka environment used by the integrations tests can be _defaulted_ with these two environment variables.

| env var                       | default | description                                                                                                                             |
|-------------------------------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `TEST_CLUSTER_EXECUTION_MODE` | `IN_VM` | `IN_VM` or `CONTAINER`. if `IN_VM`, kafka will be run same virtual machines as the integration test. Otherwise containers will be used. |
| `TEST_CLUSTER_KRAFT_MODE`     | `true`  | if true, kafka will be run in kraft mode.                                                                                               |

When the integration-tests are run in `CONTAINER` mode, the kafka/zookeeper logs are written to a location specified by
the `container.logs.dir`  system property. When run through Maven this is defaulted to `integrationtests/target/container-logs`.

Pass the `-Dquick` option to skip all tests and non-essential plug-ins and create the output artifact as quickly as possible:

```
$ mvn clean verify -Dquick
```

Run the following command to format the source code and organize the imports as per the project's conventions:

```
$ mvn process-sources
```

Build with the `dist` profile for creating an executable JAR:

```
$ mvn clean verify -Pdist -Dquick
```

Run the following to add missing license headers e.g. when adding new source files:

```
$ mvn org.commonjava.maven.plugins:directory-maven-plugin:highest-basedir@resolve-rootdir license:format
```

### Formatting
No one likes to argue about code formatting in pull requests, as project we take the stance that if we can't automate the formatting we are not going to argue about it either. Having said that we don't want a mishmash of conflicting styles! So we attack this from multiple angles.

1. Shared Code formatter settings. Included in the repo are code formatter settings for `Eclipse`, `InjtellJ` and `.editorconfig`.
2. We auto-format code as part of the maven build process (note this is driven from the Eclipse formatting config)
3. The Continuous Integration (CI) job building Pull Requests will fail if there is formatting which doesn't pass our agreed conventions
4. We apply [Checkstyle](https://checkstyle.org/) validation to the project as well. You can find our [agreed ruleset](etc/checkstyle-custom_checks.xml) in the `etc` folder. We bind checkstyle to the `verify` phase of the build so `mvn clean verify` will 

## Run

### Run natively

Build with the `dist` profile as shown above, then execute this:

```
$ java -jar kroxylicious/target/kroxylicious-*-SNAPSHOT.jar --config {path-to-kroxylicious-config}
```

Or, to run with your own class path, run this instead:

```
$ java -cp {path-to-your-class-path}:kroxylicious/target/kroxylicious-*-SNAPSHOT.jar io.kroxylicious.proxy.Kroxylicious --config {path-to-kroxylicious-config}
```

To prevent the [following error](https://www.slf4j.org/codes.html#StaticLoggerBinder):

```
Failed to load class org.slf4j.impl.StaticLoggerBinder
```

Make sure to follow the [suggestions here](https://www.slf4j.org/codes.html#StaticLoggerBinder) to include one (and only one) of the suggested jars on the classpath.

#### Debugging
Logging is turned off by default for better performance. In case you want to debug, logging should be turned on in the `example-proxy-config.yml` file:
```yaml
  logNetwork: true
  logFrames: true
```

### Run on Minikube

Kroxylicious can be containerised and run on Minikube against a [Strimzi](https://strimzi.io) managed Kafka cluster.

**Prerequisites**
* User must have a [quay.io](https://www.quay.io) account and create a public repository named `kroxylicious`
* Minikube [installed](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start)
* kubectl [installed](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools)
* kustomize [installed](https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io/installation/kustomize/)
* OSX users must have `gsed` [installed](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/gnu-sed)
* Docker engine [installed](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install) or [podman](https://podman.io/docs/installation) 

Running:

```bash
minikube delete && QUAY_ORG=$your_quay_username$ ./scripts/run-with-strimzi.sh $kubernetes example directory$
```
where `$kubernetes example directory$` is replaced by a path to an example directory e.g. `./kubernetes-examples/portperbroker_plain`.

This `run-with-strimzi.sh` script does the following:
1. builds and pushes a kroxylicious image to quay.io
2. starts minikube
3. installs cert manager and strimzi
4. installs a 3-node Kafka cluster using Strimzi into minikube
5. installs kroxylicious into minikube, configured to proxy the cluster

If you want to only build and push an image to quay.io you can run `PUSH_IMAGE=y QUAY_ORG=$your_quay_username$ ./scripts/deploy-image.sh`

To change the container engine to podman set `CONTAINER_ENGINE=podman`

## Samples

See [kroxylicious-sample](kroxylicious-sample) to learn more about sample filters. Try them out and customise them for a hands-on introduction to custom filters in Kroxylicious.

## Rendering documentation

The `docs` directory has some user documentation written in [AsciiDoc](https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/) format.
You can render it to HTML using:

```
mvn org.asciidoctor:asciidoctor-maven-plugin:process-asciidoc@convert-to-html
```

The output will be in `target/html/master.html`. 

## Performance Testing

See [benchmarking.md](benchmarking.md) for information on running basic performance tests for this proxy.

### Jenkins pipeline for performance
When a PR is created and the performance tests are needed, the following comment shall be added into the PR:

```
@strimzi-ci run perf
```

It will launch the `kroxylicious-performance-tests-pr` build, that will insert a comment with a summary into the PR comparing the results with the previous execution.

In case a manual execution needs to be done, this job is ready for that `kroxylicious-performance-tests`, where
some parameters can be configurable (NUMBER_OF_MESSAGES, MESSAGE_SIZE, PRODUCER_PROPERTIES)

## Architecture Monitoring

This project uses [Deptective ðŸ•µ](https://github.com/moditect/deptective/) for monitoring its architecture and fails any violations,
either in form of unwanted package dependencies or circular package dependencies.
The target dependency model is configured in the [deptective.json](kroxylicious/src/main/resources/META-INF/deptective.json) file.
Any new package relationships need to be registered there.

To verify whether the code base adheres to that target model, run the following:

```
$ mvn clean verify -Dquick -Parchitecture-check -pl kroxylicious
```

In case of any architecture violations, the actual architecture can be visualized using GraphViz like so:

```
$ dot -Tpng kroxylicious/target/generated-sources/annotations/deptective.dot > kroxylicious-arch.png
```

## IntelliJ setup

Open the root `pom.xml` as a project.

## License

This code base is available under the Apache License, version 2.

## Setting Up in Windows Using WSL
While Kroxylicious is a java application we've had reports of issues running the build natively on Windows and thus suggest using the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) for development.
### Installing WSL

1. Enable the Windows Subsystem for Linux feature: To enable WSL, you need to enable the Windows Subsystem for Linux
   feature in the Windows Features dialog.
2. Install a Linux distribution from the Microsoft Store. The rest of these instructions assume a distribution (such as
   Ubuntu) which uses `apt` for package management, but the process should be similar for distributions using other
   package managers/ such as Fedora/`dnf`.
3. Launch the Linux distribution and Configure the Linux environment: After launching the Linux distribution, you can
   configure the environment by creating a user account and setting the password.
   With these steps, you should now have WSL installed and configured on your Windows system.
   For further assistance please see the [Microsoft documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
### Ensure appropriate tooling available
1. Open the WSL window.
2. Update the packages using
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt upgrade
    ```
3. 
    1. Check the Java version by typing
      ```bash
      java --version
      ```
      Expect output similar to: 
      ```bash
      > java --version
   openjdk 19.0.2 2023-01-17
   OpenJDK Runtime Environment Temurin-19.0.2+7 (build 19.0.2+7)
   OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Temurin-19.0.2+7 (build 19.0.2+7, mixed mode, sharing)
   ```
    2. Update if needed: sample update command like:
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt upgrade
    sudo apt install openjdk-18-jre-headless
    ```
4. Ensure GIT is available
   1. ```bash
      git --version
      ```
      Expect a version string similar to `git version 2.37.1 (Apple Git-137.1)`
   2. Follow the [WSL-git tutorial](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-git) if needed.
5. Checkout Kroxylicious to `${kroxylicious-checkout}`
6. Build & develop following the [standard build](#Build) instructions
