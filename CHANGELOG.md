### Changes, deprecations and removals

The Filter API is refactored to be fully asynchronous.  Filter API methods such as `#onXxxxRequest` and `onXxxxResponse`
now are required to return a `CompletionStage<FilterResult>`. The `FilterResult` encapsulates the message to be
forwarded and carries orders (such as close the connection). The context provides factory methods for creating
`FilterResult` objects.

The default metrics port has changed from 9193 to 9190 to prevent port collisions

Filter Authors can now implement CompositeFilter if they want a single configuration block to contribute multiple Filters
to the Filter chain. This enables them to write smaller, more focused Filter implementations but deliver them as a whole
behaviour with a single block of configuration in the Kroxylicious configuration yaml. This interface is mutually exclusive
with RequestFilter, ResponseFilter or any specific message Filter interfaces.

In the kroxylicious config, the brokerAddressPattern parameter for the PortPerBroker scheme no longer accepts or requires
:$(portNumber) suffix.  In addition, for the SniRouting scheme the config now enforces that there is no port specifier
present on the brokerAddressPattern parameter. Previously, it was accepted but would lead to a failure later.

Kroxylicious configuration no longer requires a non empty `filters` list, users can leave it unset or configure in an empty
list of filters and Kroxylicious will proxy to the cluster successfully.
