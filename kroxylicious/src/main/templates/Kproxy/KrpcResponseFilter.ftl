/**
 * <p>Interface for {@code *ResponseFilter}s.
 * This interface can be implemented in two ways:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>filter classes can (multiply) implement one of the RPC-specific subinterfaces such as {@link ProduceResponseFilter} for a type-safe API</li>
 *     <li>filter classes can extend {@link KrpcGenericResponseFilter}</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>When implementing one or more of the {@code *ResponseFilter} subinterfaces you need only implement
 * the {@code on*Response} method(s), unless your filter can avoid deserialization in which case
 * you can override {@link #shouldDeserializeResponse(ApiKeys, short)} as well.</p>
 *
 * <p>When extending {@link KrpcGenericResponseFilter} you need to override {@link #apply(DecodedResponseFrame, KrpcFilterContext)},
 * and may override {@link #shouldDeserializeResponse(ApiKeys, short)} as well.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Guarantees</h3>
 * <p>Implementors of this API may assume the following:</p>
 * <ol>
 *     <li>That each instance of the filter is associated with a single channel</li>
 *     <li>That {@link #shouldDeserializeResponse(ApiKeys, short)} and
 *     {@link #apply(DecodedResponseFrame, KrpcFilterContext)} (or {@code on*Response} as appropriate)
 *     will always be invoked on the same thread.</li>
 *     <li>That filters are applied in the order they were configured.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>From 1. and 2. it follows that you can use member variables in your filter to
 * store channel-local state.</p>
 *
 * <p>Implementors should <strong>not</strong> assume:</p>
 * <ol>
 *     <li>That filters in the same chain execute on the same thread. Thus inter-filter communication/state
 *     transfer needs to be thread-safe</li>
 * </ol>
