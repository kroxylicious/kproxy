/**
 * The FilterInvoker connects Kroxylicious with the concrete implementation of a KrpcFilter.
 * <p>When handling a message, we want to avoid the penalty of deserializing the bytes
 * into an ApiMessage. When Kroxylicious receives a message, all the Filters in the
 * filter chainnwill be consulted (via their invoker) to see if any want to handle that message.
 * If any filter wants to handle it, then the message will be deserialized. Then
 * onRequest|onResponse will be eligible to be called in the filter chain for that
 * message (i.e. if filter A wants to handle request Y but filter B doesn't, only the
 * onRequest of A would be invoked)</p>
 * <h2>Guarantees</h2>
 * <p>Implementors of this API may assume the following:</p>
 * <ol>
 *     <li>That each instance of the FilterInvoker is associated with a single channel</li>
 *     <li>That {@link #shouldHandleRequest(ApiKeys, short)} and
 *     {@link #onRequest(ApiKeys, RequestHeaderData, ApiMessage, KrpcFilterContext)} (or {@code on*Request} as appropriate)
 *     will always be invoked on the same thread.</li>
 *     <li>That filters are applied in the order they were configured.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>From 1. and 2. it follows that you can use member variables in your filter to
 * store channel-local state.</p>
 *
 * <p>Implementors should <strong>not</strong> assume:</p>
 * <ol>
 *     <li>That invokers in the same chain execute on the same thread. Thus inter-filter communication/state
 *     transfer needs to be thread-safe</li>
 * </ol>
